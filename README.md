# Sample SuperStore

This notebook is intended for those whose relatively new to EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) aspect from a Machine Learning process. The sample was taken from the legendary dataset "Sample Superstore", of a fictional Ecommerce company. This Notebook is running on top of the following stacks :

- [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/)
- [Pandas 1.0.4](https://pandas.pydata.org/getting_started.html)
- [Matplotlib 3.2.1](https://matplotlib.org/3.2.1/contents.html)

The learning curve was designed, even for those whose relatively coming from a non-technical background. Each of the phase would only require for you to copy and paste the code to your Jupyter Notebook instance. The learning steps are describe as the following examples:

- 01 - Data Exploration - SampleSuperStore.ipynb
- 02 - Data Cleaning - SampleSuperStore.ipynb
- 03 - Data Grouping - SampleSuperStore.ipynb
- 04 - Data Sorting - SampleSuperStore.ipynb
- 05 - Data Pivot - SampleSuperStore.ipynb
- 06- Data Visualization - SampleSuperStore.ipynb

So be sure to match those above mentioned technical requirements. Fell free to fork, download and enhance the Notebooks files. This is a work in progress, and I wouldn't consider this a finish project.
